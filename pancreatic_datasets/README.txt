Single-cell RNA-seq with spike-in cells enables accurate quantification of cell-specific drug effects in pancreatic islets (Marquina-Sanchez et al.; 2020)
Mouse; SC; UMI

Comprehensive alpha, beta and delta cell transcriptomes reveal that ghrelin selectively activates delta cells and promotes somatostatin release from pancreatic islets (DiGruccio et al. 2016)
Mouse; bulk
These are alpha, beta, and delta cells; the beta cell samples are the mCherry+ labels and mixed (I think???) alpha and delta cell samples are the YFP+ labels
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921781/

Transcriptomic profiling of pancreatic alpha, beta and delta cell populations identifies delta cells as a principal target for ghrelin in mouse islets (Adriaenssens et al. 2016)
Mouse; bulk
Alpha, beta, and delta cells seem to be differentiated in the sequencing data!
